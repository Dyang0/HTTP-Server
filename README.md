# HTTPS-Server
Builds off a simple server implementation in C. I want to create a robust HTTPS server, keeping security in mind.

# Learning Objectives
- Understand the differences between HTTP and HTTPS servers. Transition the base HTTP server into a HTTPS server
- Use pentesting/vulnerabilitiy tools to create a robust server
- Document misconceptions and roadblocks. This ties with the disclaimer below

\*DISCLAIMER: This is a developing project so take the information with a grain of salt. The goal is to promote the learning experience rather than getting everything right at the start.
